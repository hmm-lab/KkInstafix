# KkInstafix

Telegram bot that rewrites social media links so Telegram previews work better.

It supports Instagram, Twitter/X, TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, Threads, Bluesky, Pixiv, Tumblr, Bilibili, Snapchat, Spotify, Twitch, iFunny, FurAffinity, and DeviantArt.

- Keeps Telegram link previews enabled with large media previews when possible.
- Preserves reply chains when reposting fixed links.
- Supports captioned media posts with links.
- Deduplicates repeated links, stickers, GIFs, and repeated plain text spam.
- Per-user rate limiting.
- Admin-only moderation and config commands.
- SQLite storage so settings survive restarts.
- Provider fallback if one fixer host is down.
- Welcome message when added to a new group.
- About / credits commands with custom image support.

## Anti-spam behavior

- Same link can be blocked for a configurable dedup window.
- Same sticker or GIF can be deleted if repeated.
- Same plain text can be deleted if repeated and text spam protection is enabled.
- Muted users can have their messages auto-deleted.
- Repeated webhook / polling updates are ignored.

## Files

- `bot.py` — main bot code.
- `30364.jpg` — image used by `/mehrab`, `/mo`, `/genius`, `/about`, `/credits`, `/me`.
- `Procfile` — start command.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `bot_data.sqlite3` — auto-created SQLite database.

## Deploy on Railway

1. Push the repo to GitHub.
2. Create a new Railway project from the repo.
3. Add environment variables:
   - `BOT_TOKEN` — required.
   - `WEBHOOK_URL` — recommended. Set to your Railway public URL (e.g. `https://your-app.railway.app`). Enables webhook mode, which is more reliable than polling. Leave unset to use polling instead.
   - `PORT` — set automatically by Railway; do not override.
4. Make sure the start command uses lowercase:
   - `python bot.py`
5. Deploy.

If you use a `Procfile`, the worker line should also use lowercase:

```procfile
worker: python bot.py
```

## Required bot permissions

In Telegram groups, give the bot these admin permissions if you want full functionality:

- Delete messages
- Read messages
- Post messages / send messages

Without delete permission, the bot can still reply in some cases, but spam cleanup and link replacement will be limited.

## Notes

- Twitter and X are treated as the same platform.
- Instagram default is `ee`.
- Caption link fixing replies with corrected links instead of re-uploading media.
- Settings are stored per chat.
- The database is created automatically on startup.

## Troubleshooting

### Bot starts but does nothing

- Check that `BOT_TOKEN` is set correctly.
- Make sure the bot is added to the group.
- Make sure privacy mode is configured the way you want in BotFather.
- Make sure the bot has permission to delete messages if you expect it to replace messages.

### Conflict: terminated by other getUpdates request

Usually means another instance of the bot is still running somewhere else.

### Preview does not show every time

Telegram preview generation is controlled by Telegram itself, so some providers may still work better than others depending on the link. Use `/testall <platform> <url>` to compare providers.
